# ML-Project
It will predict the upcoming importance question from the previous year question paper by using machine learning algorithm.
📌 Model Description
The proposed machine learning model aims to predict upcoming important exam questions based on patterns learned from previous year question papers (PYQs). This is particularly beneficial for students and educators, as it provides data-driven insights into the types and topics of questions likely to appear in future exams.

🧠 Objective
To build a predictive system that analyzes a historical dataset of past question papers (e.g., last 5 years) and identifies:

Frequently asked topics

Question types by mark weightage (1, 2, 5, 10 marks)

Trends and patterns in question distribution

The model will output the most probable important questions for upcoming exams.

🔍 Input Data
Previous Year Questions (structured dataset)

Year

Subject/Unit

Question text

Topic

Marks weightage (1, 2, 5, 10)

Additional metadata (optional)

Keywords

Question type (theoretical/numerical)

Difficulty level

🛠️ ML Approach
The model is a classification and ranking system combining:

Text Processing (NLP): To clean and vectorize question text using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec or BERT).

Topic Modeling: Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or clustering to extract key recurring topics.

Classification Algorithms: To classify questions into mark categories and predict the probability of recurrence.

Algorithms: Random Forest, XGBoost, or Logistic Regression

Trend Analysis: Time series or frequency-based analysis to identify rising topics over the years.

🧪 Training and Evaluation
Data Split: 80% training, 20% testing

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy

Precision/Recall

F1 Score

Mean Reciprocal Rank (for ranking predictions)

🎯 Output
A ranked list of predicted important questions/topics for the upcoming exam

Visualization of topic trends and question recurrence

Categorization by marks for targeted preparation
